## What we'll make

## Setting up the project

The easiest way to get started is by starting a new TypeScript Repl at <https://repl.it/languages/typescript> (if you would prefer to use a local environment instead, go ahead). I would recommend renaming it to something like "My Multiplayer Game" from the dropdown at the top so you can easily find it again.

First, we need to install the Colyseus server framework. Navigate to the "packages" tab in your new Repl project and search for "colyseus". Once you find it, select it and click on the plus icon to add it to your project.
