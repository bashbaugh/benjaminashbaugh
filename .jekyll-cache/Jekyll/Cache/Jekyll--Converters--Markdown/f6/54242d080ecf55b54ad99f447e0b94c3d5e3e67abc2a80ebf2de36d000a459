I"I<p>A very simple (and bad) game I made with python in which you defend a base that is running out of energy against missiles with shields and a radar tower. I also built a homemade controller for it using an arduino and some switches. I wrote <a href="/projects/radar-defense-game">a short post about it</a> after I made it.</p>
