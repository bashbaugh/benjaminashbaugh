For my first hackathon ever, I participated in [ByteHacks](https://bytehacks.tech/) 2020, a student-led high school virtual hackathon. The theme was to create a app that would have helped people during a historical event, so my team created an app to help people find jobs, aid establishments, and more during the Great Depression. As my first hackathon app, it wasn't the best it was still very fun to make.
