This year, [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) (A global network of code-loving high-school students) started something called [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/), challenging members to learn more about tech and create cool hardware projects. I decided to use the opportunity to create something I've always wanted to make - a model self-driving car, inspired by the [Donkey Car Project](https://donkeycar.com).

Right now, I'm in the process of designing and building the car - which includes a 3d-printed chassis and frame, and a custom i2c control circuit. I will be writing about the process in detail here, but posting short updates and photos on the [Summer of Making scrapbook](https://scrapbook.benjaminashbaugh.me/).

### The RC car

The Donkey Car project is based on a pre-built RC car from Exceed RC, but I wanted to build my own RC car from scratch to add to the challenge. I know that 3d printed materials (especially PLA) tend to be quite brittle - so I have no idea how well a 3d-printed car will hold together after crashes. But videos of 3d-printed RC cars show them performing quite well, and I will mostly be driving my car indoors - so I decided I'd give it a try. I started on Thigiverse, and found a few good designs I like:

+ [DIY RC Street Racing Car V2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3685946)
+ [OpenRC 1:10 4WD Truggy Concept RC Car](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42198)
+ [OpenRC F1 car - 1:10 RC Car](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1193309) 
+ [OpenRC 1:10 4WD Touring RC Car](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3340289)
+ [3D Printed RC Car V3 -- Tarmo3](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3546277)

I'm think that I'll probably go with a modified version of the touring car, which is nice because it's 1/10 scale, and seems to have a nice mix of metal parts and 3d-printed parts. However, I will probably use a brushed motor rather than the sensored brushless motor.

For model self-driving cars, brushless motors are bad because they aren't good for slow speeds (this is because, without brushes, there is nothing to physically slow/stabilize the armature in the motor). self-driving cars need to be able to drive slowly for training (plus you probably don't want your AI driving your car at super-fast speeds...). Sensored brushless motors are fine because the sensors make the motors very good at all speeds, but they are a lot more expensive than brushed motors.

That's all for now - but I'll continue updating this as I work on this project!
