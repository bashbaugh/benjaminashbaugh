There are a few super-useful websites, services, and software I use all the time for web development. A lot of them are very common and well-known, like Google Cloud Platform, but I thought I'd share the list anyway. Note: I am not sponsored by any of these companies.

### Hosting

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is absolutely amazing. They make it extremely easy to host static websites, and they have so many extra features such as post-processing, serverless server-side functions, forms, analytics, and more.
