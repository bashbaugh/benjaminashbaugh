Slack bots (also called slack apps) are an integral part of the Hack Club slack. In this workshop, you will learn how to make your own slack bot using Node.js.

## Setup

Before we can start, we need to register a new Slack App.  You have to associate a every slack app with a slack workspace, so I'd recommend creating a new slack workspace called "My personal space" or "Bot development" so that you can easily experiment with your bot without accidentally bothering anyone else. Alternatively, you can create your bot on the Hack Club slack and test it in the [#bot-spam](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0P5NE354) channel. 

Make sure you're [signed in](https://slack.com/signin#/signin), then navigate to your [app dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and select "Create New App".
