One of my favorite times of the year for making is Halloween. There are so many cool things to create to freak the trick-or-treaters out. In this post, I will list a few of the ones I've made. Keep in mind: I will add to this list as time goes on, so check back in on it every once in a while!"

### 1. Motion-sensing Halloween Skull
[![Picture of the halloween skull](/img/post-images/halloween_skull.jpg)](https://www.instructables.com/id/Scary-Motion-sensing-Moving-Halloween-Skull/)

This is one of the first Halloween projects I ever made, and actually one of the first good arduino projects I ever made. This looks like an ordinary plastic skull to trick-or-treaters - until they get close to it. It then comes alive and turns it's head to look straight at them, and its eyes glow red and yellow. It's very simple; it is mounted on a microservo which rotates the skull, while LEDs in the eyes light up. It uses the very common HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor to detect motion. 

I entered this project in the [Instructables Halloween Contest 2018](https://www.instructables.com/contest/halloween18/) - an annual contest put on by [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/), a website which contains thousands of DIY tutorials for all sorts of things. It was the very first instructable I've ever written, you can [find it here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Scary-Motion-sensing-Moving-Halloween-Skull/). If you like this project, please vote for it in [the contest](https://www.instructables.com/contest/halloween18/).
