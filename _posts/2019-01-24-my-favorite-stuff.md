Here is a list of my favorite useful awesome websites, companies, services, and more. Updated often, so check back in soon!

They are organized by category.

### Programming and Web Development

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/) + [GitHub](https://github.com/)**. A version control system. I had to list this first because it is by far one of the most useful tools that I (and hundreds of thousands of other developers) use all the time. If you're a programmer and you're not familiar with it, check out [my Git Tutorial](/code/2018/simple-git-github-tutorial) which briefly explains what it is.
