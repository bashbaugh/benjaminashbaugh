The first medium-sized website I created was a blog, made with Jekyll and HTML/CSS/JS/markdown with the help of the le4ker's [Personal Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/le4ker/personal-jekyll-theme). I originally hosted it on github pages, then on netlify at scitronboy.com. Now, [I'ved moved it to this domain.](/blog)
