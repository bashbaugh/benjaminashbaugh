In this post I will try to explain what version control, Git and GitHub is, why you should use them, and how to use them, as simply as I can.

I will only go over the basics and only a few more advanced points in this article.

I will assume that you know how to use the command line.

### What is Version Control and Git???

Git is a version control system. In this article, I will focus on Git, which is the most popular version control system.

Version Control is a piece of software that helps teams or individuals manage their source code over time. It tracks changes in a project so that if something breaks while you are working on it, you can compare the difference between the current project and a previous version of the project. You can even "checkout" a previous version of the project and make changes to it. Also, with Git you can have separate "branches," which are separate, parallel "versions" of the project that can be worked on simultaneously. For example, one member of a team can work on a feature at the same time as another person (or the same person) works on a different feature. Once the features are finished, they can both be (hopefully seamlessly) be merged back into the main branch (called the master branch).

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is mostly a Hub for Git projects. That is, it is a platform that interfaces with Git to store projects that use Git in the cloud. It is useful for when you have multiple people or computers working on the project, because people can easily update their version of the project with a simple Git command. GitHub is also useful for ensuring that you have backups of your project, because if your version gets deleted you can just clone the entire project, including the entire history of the project, from the GitHub cloud.

Sign up for a GitHub account [at github.com](github.com). Paid accounts allow you to make your projects private. Unless you are working on a very private project you don't need a paid account (Duh). If someone else invites you to work on their private project, you do __not__ need a paid account to work on their project as a collaborator. If you are a student or teacher you can sign up for a [free paid account](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) after you sign up for a standard account.
