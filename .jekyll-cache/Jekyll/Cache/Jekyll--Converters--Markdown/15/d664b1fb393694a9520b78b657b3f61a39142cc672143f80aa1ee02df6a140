I"û<p>As you may have noticed, this siteâ€™s been kind of dead, as my last post was in march. The good news is, I will be making a new, more personal site in early 2020 to advertise myself. It will be on a new domain, and I will be moving this blog to a subdomain there and hopefuly reviving it a little. On a different note, Iâ€™ve been working on another project lately - a multiplayer math game. Itâ€™s not ready yet, but you can learn about it at <a href="https://arithmerace.com">arithmerace.com</a>.</p>
