For the [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/) 2019, I created a simple multiplayer competitive online math racing game called Arithmerace, designed to help elementary school students improve their arithmetic skills. The first prototype I made is [open source here](https://github.com/arithmerace/original-arithmerace-demo) and you can try it out at [alpha.arithmerace.com](https://alpha.arithmerace.com/). I'm also planning to release a new and improved version sometime soon, so visit [arithmerace.com](https://arithmerace.com/) for updates.
