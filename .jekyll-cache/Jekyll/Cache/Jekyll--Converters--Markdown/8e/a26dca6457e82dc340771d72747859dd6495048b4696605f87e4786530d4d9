I"`<p>The first medium-sized website I created was a blog, made with Jekyll and HTML/CSS/JS/markdown with the help of the le4ker’s <a href="https://github.com/le4ker/personal-jekyll-theme">Personal Jekyll Theme</a>. I originally hosted it on github pages, then on netlify at scitronboy.com. Now, <a href="/blog">I’ved moved it to this domain.</a></p>
