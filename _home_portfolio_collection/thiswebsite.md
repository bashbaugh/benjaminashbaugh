A small but important project was the personal part of this website (excluding my blog). I created it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no libraries. I created it because I wanted a place online to list my projects and share info about myself, etc. You can see the code on my [repo for this website](https://github.com/scitronboy/benjaminashbaugh).
