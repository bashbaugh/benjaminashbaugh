I"¤<p>In anticipation of possibly changing domains in the future, I have re-created the Disqus comment system for this blog, so all old comments have been deleted. Luckily there werenâ€™t many of them!!! Also, I accidentally enabled ads for my site, and Disqus apparently <em>makes you pay to remove ads after youâ€™ve enabled them</em> :angry:. Recreating the comment system appears to be the only way to remove them.</p>
