I'm currently working on a few new posts for my blog. Coming sometime this week is a tutorial on making a personal "cloud" and CDN, and a tutorial on making slack bots and/or discord bots might be coming soon as well. I've also been working on updating my [robocar](https://benjaminashbaugh.me/projects/self-driving-car-process) post.
