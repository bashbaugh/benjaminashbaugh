To learn Express and mongodb, I created a simple list website where users can create public and private lists, upvote and star them, share them, etc. I never really finished all the functionality (I might in the future) but you can try it out at [listfest.herokuapp.com](https://listfest.herokuapp.com/) if you want to.
