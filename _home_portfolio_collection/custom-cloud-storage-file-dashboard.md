I used Google Cloud Platform's Storage, Load balancing and CDN services to create a personal "cloud" and CDN. Then I made a custom file management dashboard for Google Cloud Storage buckets using React.js and Cloud Functions. You can host it right on your bucket, and it allows authorized users to sign in with their google account and upload or manage files directly to their bucket. I also plan to add access control functionality, with the option to easily get a temporary link for private files. It basically allows you to make a cheap, flexible personal file storage and sharing solution.
