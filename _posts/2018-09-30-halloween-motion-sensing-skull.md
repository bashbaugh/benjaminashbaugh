One of my favorite times of the year for making is Halloween. There are so many cool things to create to freak the trick-or-treaters out. In this post, I will list a few of the ones I've made. Keep in mind: I will add to this list as time goes on, so check back in on it every once in a while!"

### 1. Motion-sensing Halloween Skull
[![Picture of the halloween skull](/img/post/halloween/skull.jpg "The Halloween Skull")](https://www.instructables.com/id/Scary-Motion-sensing-Moving-Halloween-Skull/)

This is one of the first Halloween projects I ever made, and actually one of the first good arduino projects I ever made. This looks like an ordinary plastic skull to trick-or-treaters - until they get close to it. It then comes alive and turns it's head to look straight at them, and its eyes glow red and yellow. It's very simple; it is mounted on a microservo which rotates the skull, while LEDs in the eyes light up. It uses the very common HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor to detect motion. 

I entered this project in the [Instructables Halloween Contest 2018](https://www.instructables.com/contest/halloween18/) - an annual contest put on by [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/), a website which contains thousands of DIY tutorials for all sorts of things. It was the very first instructable I've ever written, you can [find it here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Scary-Motion-sensing-Moving-Halloween-Skull/). If you like this project, please vote for it in [the contest](https://www.instructables.com/contest/halloween18/).

### 2. Haunted Cemetery Cake

I helped make this cake for Halloween with my sister and some of our friends. We wanted to make some kind of cake for the [Instructables contest](https://www.instructables.com/contest/halloween18/) so we came up with this. We used square marshmallows for the gravestones, marshmallow fondant for the bones and skulls, and icing for the grass. We also used coffee grounds as "fresh dirt" for the pathway. I think we used a bit too many coffee grounds, because parts of the cake tasted like coffee :laughing:!
